Smart Contract Overview
The subscription-manager contract implements a decentralized subscription payment system on the Stacks blockchain with the following features:

Subscription Plan Management
Create subscription plans with configurable price and billing periods
Update existing subscription plan details
Activate or deactivate subscription plans
Subscription Features
Users can subscribe to available plans
Automatic tracking of next payment due date
Support for recurring payments
Subscription cancellation
Payment Processing
Process payments in STX tokens
Track payment history
Verify payment status
Setting Up the Project
Prerequisites
Install Clarinet: The development environment for Clarity smart contracts
Node.js for running the test suite
Project Initialization
Create a new Clarinet project:
bash
clarinet new subscription-system
cd subscription-system
Generate the contract file:
bash
clarinet contract new subscription-manager
Copy the smart contract code from the first artifact into contracts/subscription-manager.clar
Testing the Smart Contract
Create a test file at tests/subscription-manager_test.ts with comprehensive tests for all contract functions.

Deployment Instructions
Local Development
Start a local development blockchain:
bash
clarinet integrate
In another terminal, run the development console:
bash
clarinet console
Test contract functions in the console:
clarity
(contract-call? .subscription-manager create-subscription "Netflix" "Streaming service" u1000000 u144)
Testnet Deployment
Configure your testnet account in settings/Testnet.toml
Deploy to testnet:
bash
clarinet deployment apply --testnet
Frontend Integration
To integrate this contract with a web frontend:

Use the @stacks/connect library to connect to users' wallets
Implement UI components for:
Browsing available subscription plans
Subscribing to plans
Managing active subscriptions
Processing payments
Security Considerations
Payment Authorization: The contract requires explicit user authorization for each payment
Access Control: Only subscription owners can modify their subscription details
Fund Safety: The contract cannot withdraw funds without proper authorization
Future Enhancements
Subscription Tiers: Support for multiple tiers within a single subscription plan
Trial Periods: Implement free trial functionality
Discount Codes: Support promotional discounts for subscriptions
Payment in SIP-010 Tokens: Extend to support other token standards
Multi-signature Approval: Add support for subscriptions requiring approval from multiple parties
Contract Limitations
Clarity doesn't support automatic execution, so payment processing requires external triggers
Limited on-chain storage for subscription metadata
Fixed payment periods based on block height rather than calendar time
Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Core contract development and testing
Phase 2: Testnet deployment and bug fixes
Phase 3: Frontend integration
Phase 4: Mainnet deployment
Phase 5: Feature extensions
